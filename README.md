# zetachain-lending
Developed a decentralized lending and borrowing platform that enables cross-chain asset transfers and collateral management. Users can deposit collateral on one blockchain (e.g., Ethereum) and borrow assets on another blockchain (e.g., Binance Smart Chain, Polygon) using ZetaChain for seamless cross-chain communication.
